My dotfiles
=================

This here is my very basic setup for keeping my dotfiles in git. I have used the
template repository for bootstraping dotfiles with [Dotbot][dotbot].

To upgrade the submodules to their latest versions, one could periodically run
`git submodule update --init --remote`.
